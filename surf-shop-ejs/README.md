# Adding Flash Messages

- Update pre-route middleware to check for error or success on the session
- Update post-route error handling middleware to console.log() the full err, then set err.message on req.session.error and redirect('back')
- Create a partial for flash messages and include it in our layouts
- Write some success messages and throw some errors to test it out
